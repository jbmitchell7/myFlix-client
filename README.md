# myFlix-client
This is the front end of a Mern Stack application that uses a custom API I created (https://github.com/jbmitchell7/myFlix).

It shows movie data including director, genre, and a poster; as well as more detailed data on the directors and genre. Users are able to search for movies by title.

Users must register and are then able to add and remove movies from their favorites as well as update any other profile data on the profile screen.
